# Welcome to Vaadin-On-Kotlin

> Warning: VoK 0.17 is a complete overhaul and the documentation is out-of-date.
> While the documentation is updated, please consult example apps for more details.

Vaadin-on-Kotlin is a web-application framework that includes everything needed to create database-backed web applications.
Please see the official documentation at [www.vaadinonkotlin.eu](https://www.vaadinonkotlin.eu).

Vaadin-on-Kotlin does not enforce you to use [Model-View-Controller (MVC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller),
Dependency Injection (DI) nor [Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_(systems_architecture)).
It by default does not use Spring nor JavaEE. Instead, Vaadin-on-Kotlin focuses on simplicity.

The View layer leverages component-oriented
programming as offered by the [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com) framework. Vaadin offers powerful components which are built on AJAX;
programming in Vaadin resembles programming in a traditional client-side framework such as JavaFX or Swing.

The database access layer is covered by the [vok-orm](https://github.com/mvysny/vok-orm) library.
`vok-orm` allows you to present the data from database rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic methods.
Using `vok-orm` is the recommended approach to access SQL databases.
Of course, you may decide not to use vok-orm and integrate with NoSQL instead, or use [JPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API) and/or [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/orm/).

Everything is combined with the conciseness of the [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
programming language, which makes Vaadin-on-Kotlin a perfect starting point for beginner programmers.
And Kotlin is statically-typed, so you can always Ctrl+Click on a code and learn how it works under the hood! 

For a Getting Started guide please see the official documentation at [www.vaadinonkotlin.eu/](https://www.vaadinonkotlin.eu/).

## Getting Started

1. Please install Java 17 JDK and git client if you haven't yet.

2. Then, at the command prompt, just type in:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mvysny/vok-helloworld-app
    cd vok-helloworld-app
    ./gradlew clean build web:appRun
    ```

3. Using a browser, go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and you'll see: "Yay! You're on Vaadin-on-Kotlin!"

4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application. You may find the following resources handy:

    * [Getting Started](https://www.vaadinonkotlin.eu/gettingstarted.html)

5. For easy development, we encourage you to edit the project sources in [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/);
  the Community Edition is enough.

## Example project

A more polished example application which you can inspire from. Just type this into your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mvysny/vaadin-on-kotlin
cd vaadin-on-kotlin
./gradlew vok-example-crud:run
```

The web app will be running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

For more information check out the [vok-example-crud](vok-example-crud) module.

## Vaadin Example project

Head to [Beverage Buddy VoK](https://github.com/mvysny/beverage-buddy-vok) for the standalone example project.

## Run the example application from Intellij IDEA Community

1. In Intellij IDEA, open the project simply by opening the `build.gradle` file, and then selecting "Open as Project".
2. To run the application from IDEA, just open *Gradle* tab, select `vok-example-crud-vokdb / Tasks / gretty / appRun`,
   right-click and select Debug. 
   The web app will be running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

If you have the Intellij IDEA Ultimate version, we recommend you to use Tomcat for development, since it offers
better code hot-redeployment:

1. Open the project in IDEA
2. Launch the `vok-example-crud-vokdb` WAR in Tomcat as described here: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/httpservlets.html

## Modules

Vaadin-on-Kotlin consists of several modules which provides you with handy functionality. To include the modules
into your project, you simply add appropriate Gradle jar dependencies to your `build.gradle`.

Every module contains a description of what exactly the module does, when you should use it and when
it might be better to use something else.

The list of modules:

* [vok-framework](vok-framework) - the very core of Vaadin-on-Kotlin which contains machinery
  for developing VoK plugins, and also the means to bootstrap/teardown the VoK runtime.
  Always included in your project when you build your app with VoK.
* [vok-util-vaadin](vok-util-vaadin) - when you want to have additional support for Vaadin.
  You typically include this module when you build your Vaadin-based app with VoK.
* [vok-framework-vokdb](vok-framework-v10-vokdb) - when you want to have additional support for Vaadin and
  the support for the database using the recommended approach.
  Includes [vok-util-vaadin](vok-util-vaadin10) and [vok-db](vok-db).
* [vok-rest](vok-rest) - when you want to expose data from your VoK app to other REST-consuming clients.
* [vok-rest-client](vok-rest-client) - when you want to consume data in your VoK app from other REST servers.
* [vok-db](vok-db) - Provides access to the database; uses [VoK-ORM](https://github.com/mvysny/vok-orm)
* [vok-security](vok-security) - provides basic security support. The documentation there explains the basics and provides links to sample projects.

## Code Examples

### Easy database transactions:

vok-orm:
```kotlin
button("Save", { db { person.save() } })
```

See [vok-orm](https://github.com/mvysny/vok-orm) for an explanation on how this works.

### Prepare your database

Simply use [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org): write Flyway scripts, add a Gradle dependency:
```groovy
compile 'org.flywaydb:flyway-core:7.1.1'
```
and introduce a context listener, to auto-update your database to the newest version before your app starts:
```kotlin
@WebListener
class Bootstrap: ServletContextListener {
    override fun contextInitialized(sce: ServletContextEvent?) {
        VaadinOnKotlin.init()
        val flyway = Flyway()
        flyway.dataSource = VaadinOnKotlin.getDataSource()
        flyway.migrate()
    }
}
```
Please scroll below for more details.

### Defining UI DSL-style

```kotlin
verticalLayout {
  formLayout {
    isSpacing = true
    textField("Name:") {
      focus()
    }
    textField("Age:")
  }
  horizontalLayout {
    w = 100.perc
    isSpacing = true
    button("Save") {
      onLeftClick { okPressed() }
      setPrimary()
    }
  }
}
```

### Simple popups

```kotlin
popupView("Details") {
  verticalLayout {
    formLayout { ... }
    button("Close", { isPopupVisible = false })
  }
}
```

### vok-orm-based grid is a breeze

Support for sorting and filtering out-of-the-box:

```kotlin
grid<User>(dataProvider = Person.dataProvider) {
  isExpand = true
  
  val filterBar = appendHeaderRow().asFilterBar(this)

  columnFor(User::id) {
      filterBar.forField(NumberRangePopup(), this).inRange()
  }
  columnFor(User::username) {
      filterBar.forField(TextField(), this).ilike()
  }
  columnFor(User::roles) {
      filterBar.forField(TextField(), this).ilike()
  }
  columnFor(User::hashedPassword)
  addButtonColumn(VaadinIcon.EDIT, "edit", { createOrEditUser(it) }) {}
  addButtonColumn(VaadinIcon.TRASH, "delete", { it.delete(); refresh() }) {}
}
```

### Advanced syntax

#### Keyboard shortcuts via operator overloading

```kotlin
import com.github.mvysny.karibudsl.v8.ModifierKey.Alt
import com.github.mvysny.karibudsl.v8.ModifierKey.Ctrl
import com.vaadin.event.ShortcutAction.KeyCode.C

button("Create New Person (Ctrl+Alt+C)") {
  onLeftClick { ... }
  clickShortcut = Ctrl + Alt + C
}
```

#### Width/height

```kotlin
button {
  icon = ...
  w = 48.px
  h = 50.perc
}
if (button.w.isFillParent) { ... }
```

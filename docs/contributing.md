# Contributing To Vaadin On Kotlin

TBD

## Reporting an Issue
Vaadin On Kotlin uses [GitHub Issue Tracking](https://github.com/mvysny/vaadin-on-kotlin/issues)
to track issues (primarily bugs and contributions of new code). If you've found
a bug in Vaadin on Kotlin, this is the place to start. You'll need to create
a (free) GitHub account in order to submit an issue, to comment on them, or
to create pull requests.

## Contributing to the Rails Documentation
Vaadin on Kotlin has two main sets of documentation: the guides, which help you learn
about Vaadin on Kotlin, and the API, which serves as a reference.

You can help improve the VoK guides by making them more coherent, consistent, or
readable, adding missing information, correcting factual errors, fixing
typos, or bringing them up to date with the latest edge VoK.

To do so, make changes to Rails guides source files (located [here](https://github.com/mvysny/vaadin-on-kotlin/tree/master/docs)
on GitHub). Then open a pull request to apply your changes to the master branch.

When working with documentation, please take into account the API
Documentation Guidelines and the Vaadin on Kotlin Guides Guidelines.
